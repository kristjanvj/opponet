A simple subscriber to contact information in the opposim demo

= Introduction =

ContactSubscriber is a simple demonstration subscriber used in the [Opposim] demo. It is included in the SimpleContactNode module and subscribes, through the Blackboard, to contact notifications issued by the ContactNotifier.

This demo implementation simply outputs contact events to the console, e.g.
   square.my laptop 1.csubscribe: Receving BB update: Contact: id=1, peer=2, type=0
   square.my laptop 1.csubscribe: Receving BB update: Contact: id=1, peer=2, type=1
   square.my laptop 1.csubscribe: Receving BB update: Contact: id=1, peer=3, type=0
   square.my laptop 1.csubscribe: Receving BB update: Contact: id=1, peer=3, type=1
More advanced implementations would presumably put this information to better use. This task is however left to our users.
