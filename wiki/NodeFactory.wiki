Factory module for dynamic instantiation of mobile nodes in OMNeT++ simulations of opportunistic networks.

= Introduction =

The node factory module dynamically instantiates mobile nodes in OMNeT++ simulations in accordance to descriptions given in trace files. 

  *  A mobility trace defines create, destroy and waypoint events for a collection of nodes. Such a trace is created using an external mobility generator, e.g. UrbanMobility from the MobiTrace toolkit, or UDel (http://udelmodels.eecis.udel.edu). 

  *  Contact traces can additionally be used. Such traces can e.g. be created from contact measurements conducted with mobile devices.
